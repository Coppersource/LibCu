/**
 * Class supporting the Copperforge Lasershark LiDAR ranging sensor.
 *
 * The Lasershark (Copperforge 12ft Laser Rangefinder) is an advanced LiDAR
 * ranging sensor that combines the STMicroelectronics VL53L1X laser ranging
 * sensor with advanced signal processing to precisely measure distances to
 * objects between 2" and 12' away, with .2" (5mm) resolution. It offers precise
 * ranging up to 12ft in an easy-to-use form factor and interface, and onboard
 * firmware allows students to interact with this complex sensor with only a
 * standard 3-wire 0.1" pitch cable and minimal programming.
 *
 * To determine distance, the sensor transmits a pulse of laser light, and
 * measures the time for it to bounce back, which can then be converted into a
 * distance measurement given the speed of light. This method is far more
 * accurate than calculating the distance based on reflected light intensity or
 * speed of sound, yielding superior performance over ultrasonic and infrared
 * sensors.
